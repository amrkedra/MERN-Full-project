1. Introduction
This documentation outlines the steps taken to set up a complete DevSecOps pipeline utilizing AWS services, Jenkins for CI/CD, ArgoCD for GitOps, and Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. The goal is to automate the infrastructure provisioning and application deployment process while maintaining high standards of security and observability.

2. Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation and setup, ensure the following tools and services are available:

AWS Account: An active AWS account with permissions to create resources like VPCs, EC2 instances, and EKS.
Local Machine Setup:
Install Git: For version control.
Install Jenkins: Either locally or in an EC2 instance.
Install Terraform: For infrastructure provisioning.
Install Ansible: For configuration management.
AWS CLI: Installed and configured with the necessary IAM permissions.
Helm: For managing Kubernetes applications.
3. Project Overview
This project involves the following main components:

Infrastructure: Provisioning AWS resources such as VPC, EKS, EC2 instances, and security groups using Terraform.
CI/CD: Building and deploying applications using Jenkins for CI and ArgoCD for CD.
Monitoring: Utilizing Prometheus and Grafana for application and infrastructure monitoring.
Security: Integrating security scanning tools like Trivy and SonarQube to ensure the application's integrity.
4. Infrastructure Provisioning
4.1 Local Jenkins Server Setup
Install Jenkins on Your Local Machine:

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Refer to the official Jenkins documentation.
Clone the Project Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/amrkedra/MERN-Full-project.git
cd MERN-Full-project/CI-CD
Create a New Pipeline in Jenkins:

Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard > New Item.
Choose Pipeline and name it (e.g., Infra-Pipeline).
In the pipeline configuration, select Pipeline script from SCM and choose Git.
Provide the repository URL and select the Jenkinsfile-infra from your cloned repository.
Add Necessary Credentials to Jenkins:

Navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials.
Add the required AWS credentials for Jenkins to access AWS resources. (Include Screenshot)
Run the Pipeline:

Execute the pipeline to provision the infrastructure.
Monitor the console output for any errors or confirmation messages.
4.2 Terraform Setup
Install Terraform:

Download and install Terraform from the official Terraform website.
Terraform Configuration:

The Terraform scripts are located in the repository. The main components include:

VPC Configuration: Defines the VPC, subnets, route tables, and internet gateway.
EKS Cluster: Provisions the EKS cluster and the necessary IAM roles.
Run Terraform Commands:

Initialize Terraform:
bash
Copy code
terraform init
Apply the configuration:
bash
Copy code
terraform apply -auto-approve
(Include Screenshots of Terraform execution)

4.3 Ansible Configuration Management
Install Ansible:

Follow the installation instructions on the Ansible website.
Ansible Playbooks:

The Ansible playbooks are located in the ansible directory within the cloned repository.
The playbooks are used to configure the Jenkins server and the Jump server.
Run Ansible Playbooks:

Execute the following command to set up Jenkins and other necessary configurations:
bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible/setup-jenkins.yml
(Include Screenshots of Ansible playbooks running successfully)

5. Continuous Integration with AWS Jenkins Server
5.1 AWS Jenkins Server Setup
Launch an EC2 Instance for Jenkins:

Use the AWS Management Console to launch an EC2 instance.
Ensure the security group allows access to port 8080.
Install Jenkins on AWS:

Follow the same installation steps as the local Jenkins setup.
Access Jenkins:

Open your browser and navigate to:
plaintext
Copy code
http://<AWS-Jenkins-EC2-Public-IP>:8080
(Include screenshots showing the AWS Jenkins setup)

5.2 CI Pipelines Setup
Frontend Pipeline:

Create a new pipeline in Jenkins for the frontend using the jenkinsfile-frontend:
Pipeline Script:
groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
                sh 'npm run build'
            }
        }
        stage('Docker Build & Push') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t <ecr-repo-url>:latest .'
                sh 'docker push <ecr-repo-url>:latest'
            }
        }
    }
}
Backend Pipeline:

Follow the same steps for creating a pipeline for the backend using jenkinsfile-backend.
(Include screenshots showing the successful execution of the frontend and backend pipelines)

6. Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD
6.1 ArgoCD Setup
Install ArgoCD on EKS:

Deploy ArgoCD in your EKS cluster using the following commands:
bash
Copy code
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
Access ArgoCD UI:

Access ArgoCD by port-forwarding:
bash
Copy code
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
Open your browser and navigate to:
plaintext
Copy code
http://localhost:8080
Login to ArgoCD:

Default username: admin
Retrieve the password with:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n argocd
Sync Applications:

Set up application sync with the Git repository containing Kubernetes manifests.
Monitor the deployment status through the ArgoCD dashboard.
(Add screenshots of the ArgoCD UI and application status)

7. Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
7.1 Prometheus Installation
Install Prometheus using Helm:
bash
Copy code
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring
7.2 Grafana Installation
Install Grafana using Helm:
bash
Copy code
helm install grafana grafana/grafana -n monitoring
7.3 Configuring Grafana
Access Grafana:

Port-forward Grafana:
bash
Copy code
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/grafana 3000:80
Log in with the default admin credentials.
Add Prometheus as a Data Source:

Navigate to Configuration > Data Sources and add Prometheus.

Import dashboards for monitoring Kubernetes cluster health and application metrics.
(Include screenshots of Grafana setup and dashboards)

8. Security Scanning with Trivy & SonarQube
8.1 Integrating Security Tools
Trivy for Container Scanning:

Use Trivy to scan Docker images in your Jenkins pipelines.
Example step in Jenkinsfile:
groovy
Copy code
stage('Security Scan') {
    steps {
        sh 'trivy image <ecr-repo-url>:latest'
    }
}
SonarQube for Code Quality:

Integrate SonarQube to analyze code quality and vulnerabilities.
Add SonarQube scanning as a stage in your CI pipeline.
